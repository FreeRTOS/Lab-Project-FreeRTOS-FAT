	ff_sys.h

	This module allow to map several separate file-sub-systems into a root directory

	For instance, a system with 3 sub sytems:

		/flash :  NAND flash driver
		/ram   :  RAM-disk driver
		/      :  SD-card driver

	In this example, the SD-card driver handles ALL files and directories which
	do not match /flash/ * or /ram/ *

	Now for instance a file call "/flash/etc/network.ini"
	will be stored as "/etc/network.ini" on the NAND drive

	This module along with ff_stdio.c make translations between absolute
	and relative paths
