## FreeRTOS+FAT: DOS Compatible Embedded FAT File System

FreeRTOS+FAT is an open source, thread aware and scalable FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 DOS/Windows compatible embedded FAT file system which was recently acquired by [Real Time Engineers ltd](). for use with and without the RTOS.

FreeRTOS+FAT is already used in commercial products, and is the file system used in the [FTP](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP/FTP_Server.html) and [HTTP](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP/HTTP_web_Server.html) server examples that are documented on the [FreeRTOS+TCP](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP/index.html) pages.

The [standard C library style API](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_FAT/Standard_File_System_API.html) includes a thread local errno value, and the lower level native API provides a rich set of detailed error codes.

## To consume FreeRTOS+FAT

### Consume with CMake
If using CMake, it is recommended to use this repository using FetchContent.
Add the following into your project's main or a subdirectory's `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare( freertos_plus_fat
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/FreeRTOS/Lab-Project-FreeRTOS-FAT.git
  GIT_TAG        master #Note: Best practice to use specific git-hash or tagged version
  GIT_SUBMODULES "" # Don't grab any submodules since not latest
)

# ...

set( FREERTOS_PLUS_FAT_DEV_SUPPORT OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
# Select the native compile PORT
set( FREERTOS_PLUS_FAT_PORT "POSIX" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
# Select the cross-compile PORT
if (CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING)
  # Eg. Zynq 2019_3 version of port
  set(FREERTOS_PLUS_FAT_PORT "ZYNQ_2019_3" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
endif()

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(freertos_plus_fat)
```

If you already have FreeRTOS in your project, you may skip the fetch content by setting `FREERTOS_PLUS_FAT_FETCH_FREERTOS` to `OFF`.

### Consuming stand-alone
It is recommended to use this repository as a submodule. Please refer to [Git Tools â€” Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
